README
======

Kit to get started with Flask and Google App Engine. Includes
a recent Flask and its dependencies.

Getting started
---------------

	Make sure you installed the GAE tools, e.g. dev_appserver, etc.
	(See: http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html, for Mac OS X
	http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/GoogleAppEngineLauncher-1.3.5.dmg)

	$ git clone git://github.com/miku/flask-gae-stub.git
	$ cd flask-gae-stub
	$ dev_appserver.py .
	
	Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/
	
Issues
------

Sometimes an ``ImportError: No module named inspect`` occurs, when
the app is started from the command line. GAE Launcher had no problem
with the same project, so this issue remains a little mystery for now.

Note: In 50% of the cases, 

	$ dev_appserver.py .
	
works fine, though.
